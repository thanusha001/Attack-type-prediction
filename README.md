## Attack Type Prediction Using Random Forest
  
  This project leverages data visualization and machine learning to analyze and predict different attack types based on network traffic data. It uses various exploratory techniques to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships, making complex data easier to understand.

# Overview
 
  This repository contains the complete implementation of a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to predict the type of cyber attack. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a series of visualizations to understand the dataset and model performance.

# Key components of this project include:
 
  Random Forest Classifier: Utilized to classify the different attack types from the dataset.
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Multiple visualizations were created to better understand the underlying data and the relationships between features.
  Model Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.
  Data Visualization
  Confusion Matrix: Provides a visualization of the classification accuracy across different attack types.
  Feature Importance Plot: Highlights which features most contribute to predicting the attack type.
  Distribution Plots: Show the distribution of key features like traffic, duration, and protocol across different attack types.

# Key features include:

  Source IP
  Destination IP
  Protocol
  Packet Count
  Duration
  Attack Type (Label)

# Data Description
  
  The dataset used for this analysis contains various network traffic features along with labeled attack types. It provides detailed information on network activities, helping to identify different types of cyber attacks.
